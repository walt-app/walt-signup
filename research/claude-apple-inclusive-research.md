# Apple Pay and Google Wallet statistics for the Walt pitch deck update

**Walt's pitch deck currently references Google Wallet statistics only.** This report provides the Apple Pay equivalent for every major data point, plus combined totals, so the deck can present the full mobile wallet landscape. All figures include source attribution and dates; discrepancies between sources are noted. The pitch deck page itself (walt.is/pitch) could not be directly fetched due to client-side rendering, but the user-identified statistics and all 10 requested categories are fully covered below.

## 1. User base and adoption numbers

The deck's claim of **520 million Google Wallet users** sits between conservative analyst estimates (~200–250M) and aggressive aggregator figures (~700–820M). No major analyst report publishes 520M specifically — the figure may include India's Google Pay UPI user base, which inflates numbers significantly but conflates two distinct products.

| Metric | Google Wallet | Apple Pay | Combined | Source & Date |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Global users (2024–25)** | **200–250M** (conservative, Chargeflow 2025); up to 520M if including India UPI broadly; 700–820M per aggressive sources (CoinLaw/ElectroIQ) | **650–800M** (mid-range consensus); 744M (Chargeflow/PYMNTS 2024); 818M (Capital One Shopping 2025) | **~1.0–1.3 billion** (mid-range) | Chargeflow, Capital One Shopping, PYMNTS, eMarketer (2024–2025) |
| **US users (2025)** | **50.9M** (eMarketer forecast via Oberlo) | **63.9–65.6M** (eMarketer/Capital One Shopping) | **~115–117M** | eMarketer/Insider Intelligence (2025) |
| **US users (2024 actual)** | **48.6M** (14.5% of population) | **60.2–61.3M** | **~109–110M** | eMarketer, Chargeflow (2024) |
| **US users (2028 projected)** | **57.0M** | **~75–95M** (range varies by source) | **~132.6M** total proximity mobile payment users | eMarketer via Oberlo (2024) |
| **Only semi-official figure from Google** | **150M** monthly active across 42 markets (2020–21) | N/A — Apple has never disclosed user counts | — | Google announcement (2020); Loup Ventures (Apple, 2020) |

**Growth rates (users)**:
- Apple Pay US: **~6.1% YoY** (2024→2025), decelerating to ~4.9% (2025→2026). Global CAGR 2020–2025: ~10%.
- Google Wallet US: **~4.8% YoY** (2024→2025). Conservative global CAGR from 150M base: 10–15%.
- Apple Pay grew **41% total** between 2022 and 2024 globally (Cropink).

**Active usage gap matters more than user counts.** Of US iPhone owners with Apple Pay enabled, **52% use it regularly** at checkout. Only **22% of Android users** with Google Pay do the same (PYMNTS 2024 survey). This engagement gap is arguably more important than raw user counts for Walt's pitch — it demonstrates the underserved Android market.

## 2. Market size and transaction volume

Walt's TAM/SAM/SOM slide should reflect the enormous and fast-growing mobile wallet market. Transaction value figures are far more meaningful than platform-revenue market sizes.

| Metric | Figure | Source & Date |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Global mobile wallet market (platform revenue, 2025)** | **$12.85–$18.37B** | Precedence Research / Research & Markets (2025) |
| **Global mobile wallet market (platform revenue, 2034)** | **$104.69B** (CAGR 26.3%) | Precedence Research (2025) |
| **Global digital wallet transaction value (2025)** | **$8.3 trillion** | Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence (Dec 2025) |
| **Global digital wallet transaction value (2030)** | **$19.7 trillion** (CAGR 18.9%) | Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence (Dec 2025) |
| **Global contactless transaction value (2025)** | **$7.7 trillion** | Juniper Research (Jul 2025) |
| **Global contactless transaction value (2030)** | **$18.1 trillion** (+106%) | Juniper Research (Jul 2025) |
| **US proximity mobile payment value (2024)** | **$670.5B** (+21.5% YoY) | eMarketer via Oberlo (2024) |
| **US proximity mobile payment value (2027)** | **>$1 trillion** | eMarketer (2024) |
| **Digital wallet share of global e-commerce (2024)** | **53%** | Worldpay/Capital One Shopping (2025) |

**Platform-specific transaction volumes:**

| Metric | Google Wallet | Apple Pay | Source & Date |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Global payment volume (2022)** | Not disclosed | **$6 trillion** (most reliable single figure) | WSJ / DOJ complaint (2024) |
| **US in-store purchase value (2024)** | Not disclosed | **$268B** | Capital One Shopping (2025) |
| **Annual transaction count (2023 est.)** | Not disclosed | **~20 billion** | Chargeflow analyst estimate (2024) |
| **Share of US in-store mobile wallet taps (2024)** | **~17%** | **~54%** | Chargeflow (2025) |
| **Share of global card transactions (2025 projected)** | N/A | **~10%** (up from 5% in 2020) | Bernstein Research (2020 projection) |

Google/Alphabet does not publicly disclose Google Pay transaction volumes. Aggressive analyst estimates (ElectroIQ) put Google Pay at ~$4.3–5.2T globally for 2024–2025, but these are unverifiable. India's UPI data is more reliable: Google Pay holds **36.1% of India's UPI volume** (NPCI records, May 2025).

## 3. Revenue and fee structures — a critical differentiator for Walt

The fee structure difference between Apple and Google is one of the most important points for Walt's pitch deck, since Walt's subscription model ($10/year) directly challenges how incumbents monetize.

| Metric | Apple Pay | Google Wallet |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Fee per credit card transaction** | **0.15%** (15 basis points) paid by issuing bank to Apple | **$0** — Google charges no interchange-style fee |
| **Fee per debit card transaction** | **$0.005** (half a cent) flat per transaction | **$0** |
| **Fee to merchants** | None additional (merchants pay standard card processing) | None additional |
| **Revenue model** | Transaction fees from banks | Ecosystem engagement, ads, partner integrations |
| **Estimated annual revenue (2022)** | **~$1.9 billion** (WSJ, most cited) | Not disclosed; estimated ~$1–3B from ecosystem |
| **Estimated annual revenue (2024)** | **~$2.7 billion** (Capital One Shopping) | Estimated ~$3.1B including ads/partners (ElectroIQ) |
| **Apple Services total revenue (FY2025)** | **$109.16 billion** (+13.5% YoY) | N/A |
| **Apple Pay as % of Apple revenue** | **~0.5–0.7%** | N/A |

Apple's 0.15% fee was a central element in the **DOJ antitrust lawsuit filed March 2024**. The DOJ argued Apple extracts payments from banks that could fund consumer innovation. Google's zero-fee model is notable — and creates a direct contrast: **Apple charges banks for NFC wallet access; Google does not; Walt charges neither banks nor advertisers, funded instead by a transparent membership fee.**

## 4. Market share across platforms and geographies

| Market | Apple Pay | Google Wallet | Source |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **US mobile wallet users (share)** | **~49%** | **~30%** | NCHStats/Insider Intelligence (2025) |
| **US in-store mobile wallet transactions** | **54%** | **17%** | Chargeflow (2024) |
| **US mobile debit wallet transactions** | **~92%** (historical; may have softened) | ~5% | Spocket/aggregators citing 2020 data |
| **US online payments** | **14.2%** | **20–25%** | Chargeflow/Cropink (2024) |
| **UK in-store** | **63%** | **37%** | Capital One Shopping/Chargeflow (2024) |
| **France in-store** | **60%** | **25–30%** | Statista Consumer Insights (Q2 2024) |
| **India in-store** | **Not available** | **82%** | Chargeflow (2024) |
| **Australia mobile payments** | **65%** | Present but trailing | Chargeflow (2024) |

Apple Pay dominates in affluent Western markets. Google Pay dominates in emerging markets, especially India. **Neither platform has a privacy-first value proposition** — this is Walt's strategic opening.

## 5. Merchant adoption and NFC infrastructure

| Metric | Figure | Source & Date |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **US merchants accepting Apple Pay** | **85–90%** of retailers | Apple (2024–2025) |
| **US merchants accepting Google Pay** | Broadly equivalent — any NFC-enabled terminal accepts both | Industry standard |
| **Global NFC-ready POS terminals shipped (2023)** | **110.7 million** | Astute Analytica/GlobeNewswire (2024) |
| **US retailers accepting contactless (2023)** | **~70%** | PSMarketResearch (2024) |
| **Eurozone POS systems supporting contactless** | **>95%** | European Central Bank (2023) |
| **New smartphones with NFC (2025)** | **>97%** | CoinLaw (2025) |
| **Banks supporting Apple Pay globally** | **11,000+** banks and network partners | Apple press release (Jan 2026) |
| **Banks supporting Google Wallet** | Not officially disclosed; comparable in most markets | Google Support |

**Largest holdout: Walmart** — 4,600+ US stores still refuse Apple Pay, Google Pay, and all NFC payments (as of early 2026). Walmart pushes its own QR-code system to preserve customer data tracking. This fact directly supports Walt's privacy narrative.

## 6. Geographic reach

| Platform | Countries/Territories | Details |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Apple Pay** | **~89–97** (Apple lists 96 on support page; "89 markets" in press releases) | Strong in North America, Europe (54 territories), Asia-Pacific. **NOT available in India** (a 1.4B-population gap). Limited in Sub-Saharan Africa. |
| **Google Wallet (tap-to-pay)** | **~86** countries | Broader presence in emerging markets. Available in India (as Google Pay). |
| **Google Wallet (passes, loyalty, tickets)** | **~146** countries | Far wider availability for non-payment features. |

Both platforms have expanded aggressively. Apple Pay added Latin American markets (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, etc.) in recent years. Google Wallet added Dominican Republic, Peru, Morocco, Jordan, and Pakistan in 2024–2025.

---

## 7. Digital identity and credentials

If Walt's deck mentions digital IDs or credentials in Google Wallet, here is the full comparison:

| Credential Type | Apple Wallet | Google Wallet |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **US state digital driver's licenses** | **13 states + Puerto Rico** (AZ, CA, CO, GA, HI, IL, IA, MD, MT, NM, ND, OH, WV) | **6 states** (AZ, CA, CO, GA, MD, NM) |
| **US Passport ID Pass** | ✅ Available to all US iPhone users. Accepted at **250+ TSA checkpoints**. Launched Nov 2025. | ✅ Available. Accepted at select TSA airports. |
| **Car keys** | **29 manufacturers, 300+ models** | Limited partnerships |
| **Hotel room keys** | **2M+ keys provisioned, 65,000+ hotel rooms** | Limited |
| **Transit passes** | **250+ regions, 800+ cities** globally | Supported in major transit systems |
| **Student IDs** | Participating universities | Participating universities |
| **Corporate/employee badges** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Privacy approach to digital IDs** | Apple "cannot see when/where users present their ID or what data was presented" | Google developing **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** technology for age verification; plans to open-source it |

Apple Wallet leads substantially in credential breadth. Google's **ZKP innovation** for privacy-preserving age verification is notable and relevant to Walt's privacy positioning.

## 8. Regulatory and competitive landscape

Three regulatory developments are transforming the mobile wallet market — all favorable to Walt's thesis:

**EU: Apple forced to open NFC (July 2024).** The European Commission accepted legally binding commitments from Apple to grant third-party wallet developers free NFC access on iOS via Host Card Emulation APIs. These commitments last **10 years** and cover payments, transit, car keys, hotel keys, and corporate badges. Since iOS 17.4, third-party contactless apps work in the EEA. This precedent may expand globally.

**US: DOJ antitrust suit proceeding (filed March 2024).** The Department of Justice plus 16 state attorneys general sued Apple for monopolization, with NFC wallet restrictions as a core allegation. In **June 2025, the court denied Apple's motion to dismiss** in full. The case will take 3–5 years but signals regulatory pressure to open Apple's wallet ecosystem. Apple's 0.15% bank fee was cited as anticompetitive extraction.

**EU: Digital Identity Wallet mandate (eIDAS 2.0).** Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 requires all EU member states to offer certified digital identity wallets by **December 2026**, and regulated industries must accept them by **November 2027**. The EU targets **80% citizen adoption by 2030**. Six large-scale pilot projects span 26 member states with 600+ partners. This creates a massive greenfield opportunity for privacy-first wallet solutions.

Additional regulatory facts:
- Apple fined **€1.8B** (music streaming antitrust, March 2024) and **€500M** (DMA anti-steering, April 2025 — first-ever DMA fine). Apple appealing the €500M.
- UK CMA designated Apple under the DMCC Act (July 2025) with planned conduct requirements.
- US CFPB digital wallet supervision rule was **enacted December 2024 then repealed** via Congressional Review Act in early 2025. No unified federal supervisory framework exists.

## 9. Key combined statistics for the updated pitch deck

For slides that need a single combined "market opportunity" number, these are the most defensible figures:

| Pitch Deck Claim | Recommended Updated Figure | Source |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| "520M Google Wallet users" | **~1.0–1.3 billion combined** Apple Pay + Google Wallet users globally (mid-range 2025 estimate) | Chargeflow, Capital One Shopping, eMarketer |
| TAM: Mobile wallet market | **$8.3 trillion** in digital wallet transaction value (2025), growing to **$19.7 trillion by 2030** | Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence (Dec 2025) |
| US proximity payments | **$670.5 billion** (2024), exceeding **$1 trillion by 2027** | eMarketer |
| NFC terminal readiness | **>95% in Europe**, ~70% in US, **>97% of new smartphones** ship with NFC | ECB, PSMarketResearch, CoinLaw |
| US mobile wallet users | **~117 million** total proximity mobile payment users (2025) | eMarketer |
| Growth trajectory | **17–19% CAGR** for global digital wallet transactions through 2030 | Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence, Juniper Research |

---

## 10. Data quality and what to flag as estimates

Neither Apple nor Google officially discloses wallet user counts or transaction volumes. **Every user figure cited in this report is a third-party estimate.** The most reliable anchors are:

- **Apple Pay ~507M** activated users in 2020 (Loup Ventures — last hard third-party estimate)
- **Google Pay ~150M** monthly active users across 42 markets (Google's own 2020–21 figure)
- **Apple Pay $6 trillion** in global payment volume for 2022 (WSJ/DOJ complaint — most reliable transaction figure)
- **Apple Pay $1.9 billion** revenue in 2022 (WSJ — most cited revenue figure)
- **US proximity mobile payments $670.5B** in 2024 (eMarketer — well-established methodology)

For the pitch deck, recommend sourcing from **eMarketer, Juniper Research, and Capital One Shopping** as the most credible, methodologically transparent analyst firms. Avoid citing aggressive aggregator sites (CoinLaw, ElectroIQ) as primary sources unless cross-referenced. The **520M Google Wallet figure in the current deck is likely overstated** relative to the most rigorous estimates and should be replaced with a properly sourced number or reframed as a combined Apple Pay + Google Wallet figure.

---

## The strategic frame for Walt's updated deck

Walt's pitch should emphasize three numbers that tell its story most powerfully: **1 billion+ people** use Apple Pay or Google Wallet, yet only **22% of Android users** regularly tap to pay (vs. 52% of iPhone users), and **$0** is what users currently pay in transparent fees — because the real cost is their privacy and data. Walt's €10/year model replaces that hidden cost with an honest one. The regulatory winds — EU NFC opening, DOJ antitrust suit, eIDAS 2.0 wallet mandates — are all blowing toward open, privacy-respecting alternatives to the incumbent duopoly.
