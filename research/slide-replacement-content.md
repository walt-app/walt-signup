## Slide 1: Title

**CURRENT:**
> WALT
> Private tap-to-pay for Android
> Pre-Seed Investment Opportunity
> walt.is

**REPLACEMENT:**
> WALT
> Private tap-to-pay
> Pre-Seed Investment Opportunity
> walt.is

**Changes:** Remove "for Android" from tagline. Product now covers both platforms.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**CURRENT:**
- Header: "Your daily spending reveals who you are."
- Body: "Every tap-to-pay transaction on an Android phone routes through Google Wallet. Google harvests this data along with Google Search, Gmail, Calendar, Google Maps data to build intimate profiles of your life, values, and future behavior."
- Quote: "To know what you spend your money on each day is also to know what you will spend your money on each day."
- Stats card title: "Google Wallet by the numbers:"
- Stats: 520M users worldwide / $5.2T processed annually / 55B contactless card payments in Europe
- Sources: Coinlaw research, European Central Bank

**REPLACEMENT:**
- Header: "Your daily spending reveals who you are." *(no change)*
- Body: "Every tap-to-pay transaction routes through Apple Pay or Google Wallet. Apple charges banks a 0.15% fee on every credit card tap and controls which wallets can access NFC on iPhone. Google harvests transaction data alongside Search, Gmail, Calendar, and Maps to build intimate profiles of your life, values, and future behavior. Neither treats your spending data as private."
- Quote: *(no change)*
- Stats card title: "Mobile wallets by the numbers:"
- Stats:
  - **Apple Pay: ~650M users** worldwide (2025 est.)
  - **Google Pay: ~520M users** worldwide (2025 est.)
  - **~$14T** combined processed annually (est.)
  - **23.2B** contactless card payments in euro area (H2 2023, +16% YoY)
- Sources: CoinLaw (est.), European Central Bank

**Notes:** The dual-wallet framing is stronger than Google-only. Apple's 0.15% bank fee is a powerful detail — it shows Apple monetizes payments differently than Google (fees vs. data) but neither is user-aligned. The ECB figure is more defensible than "55B" which is hard to source. Consider showing Apple Pay and Google Pay stats side-by-side in two columns for visual impact.

## Slide 3: No Alternatives Exist

**CURRENT:**
- Subtitle: "For Android users who want tap-to-pay without surveillance, current options are:"
- Card 1: "Switch Ecosystems — Buy an iPhone or Samsung. Expensive, inconvenient, and still involves other data-hungry companies."
- Card 2: "Go Backwards — Use cash or physical cards. Lose convenience, risk loss/theft, carry more items."
- Card 3: "Accept It — 73% of US consumers feel they have no control over how companies use their data."
- Callout: "Android holds 71% of the global smartphone market. There is no privacy-preserving tap-to-pay option for Android."
- Sources: Pew Research, Exploding Topics

**REPLACEMENT:**
- Subtitle: "For anyone who wants tap-to-pay without surveillance, current options are:"
- Card 1: "Switch to Cash — Go backwards. Use physical cards or cash. Lose convenience, risk loss/theft, carry more items."
- Card 2: "Use a Big Tech Wallet — Apple charges banks per tap. Google harvests your data. Neither offers privacy by default."
- Card 3: "Accept It — 73% of US consumers feel they have no control over how companies use their data."
- Callout: "Android + iOS = 99.6% of smartphones globally. There is no privacy-preserving tap-to-pay option on either platform."
- Sources: Pew Research, StatCounter (Jan 2026)

**Notes:** The old "Switch Ecosystems" card (buy an iPhone) no longer makes sense — iPhone has the same privacy problem. Reframing the three options as Cash / Big Tech / Accept It is cleaner and platform-agnostic. The 99.6% combined stat is more powerful than 71% Android alone — it says "there is nowhere to hide."

## Slide 4: The Solution

**CURRENT:**
- Lead: "Walt is the private alternative to Google Wallet."
- Body: "A tap-to-pay wallet for Android that treats transaction data as sacred. No collection. No storage. No selling."
- Pillars: 1. Transaction data stays encrypted on your device / 2. No server-side transaction storage / 3. Funded by users, not data monetization
- Philosophy card: "No AI. No premium features. There's only one user flow that matters. Load a card, set Walt as default wallet, start tapping to pay."
- Tagline: "Deliberately simple. Intentionally focused."

**REPLACEMENT:**
- Lead: "Walt is the private alternative to Apple Pay and Google Wallet."
- Body: "A tap-to-pay wallet for Android and iOS that treats transaction data as sacred. No collection. No storage. No selling."
- Pillars: *(no change — all platform-agnostic)*
- Philosophy card: *(no change — platform-agnostic)*
- Tagline: *(no change)*

**Changes:** Two substitutions in the lead and body. Everything else is already platform-agnostic.

---

## Slide 5: Product

**CURRENT:**
- Title: "Product — Simple and straightforward. A predictable, familiar wallet app."
- 3-step flow: Download → Add Cards → Tap to Pay
- Download panel: "Once generally available" + phone mockup (Android)
- Add Cards panel: "Enter card details. Everything stays encrypted locally. Unencrypted card details never leave your device." + phone mockup
- Tap to Pay panel: "Hold your phone near any NFC terminal. Same predictable experience you're used to with Google Wallet or Apple Pay." + phone mockup

**REPLACEMENT:**
- Title: *(no change)*
- Download panel: "Available on Android and iOS" (replace "Once generally available")
- Add Cards panel: *(no change — platform-agnostic)*
- Tap to Pay panel: *(no change — already mentions both platforms)*
- Phone mockups: Consider adding an iPhone mockup alongside the Android one, or use a generic/neutral phone frame

**Changes:** Minor — update availability text, possibly add iOS mockup. The "Tap to Pay" panel already references both platforms.

---

## Slide 6: Why Now?

**CURRENT:**
- Card 1 — PRIVACY AWARENESS SURGING: "300K+ r/degoogle members with 8K weekly conversations"
- Card 2 — TAP-TO-PAY EXPLODING: "91% of UK 25-34 year-olds use contactless regularly"
- Card 3 — LEGISLASTION [typo]: "Digital Markets Act — Prior to July 2024, it was not possible to build a replacement for Google Wallet."
- Card 4 — Privacy Alternatives Winning: "Google Search competes with DuckDuckGo, ChatGPT / Gmail competes with ProtonMail, Hey.com / Chrome competes with Firefox, Brave"
- Card 5 — The Gap: "Every major Google product has a privacy-focused competitor. However, competition was for Google Wallet was only unlocked in late 2024."
- Sources: European Central Bank

**REPLACEMENT:**
- Card 1 — PRIVACY AWARENESS SURGING: "300K+ r/degoogle members. Apple fined €1.8B + €500M by EU for anti-competitive practices (2024–2025). Users increasingly distrust both platforms."
- Card 2 — TAP-TO-PAY EXPLODING: "23.2B contactless card payments in the euro area in H2 2023 (+16% YoY). 95% of cardholders have used contactless. >97% of new smartphones ship with NFC."
- Card 3 — LEGISLATION [fix typo]: "EU opened iPhone NFC to rival wallets (July 2024). US DOJ antitrust suit targeting Apple Pay proceeding (filed March 2024, motion to dismiss denied June 2025). eIDAS 2.0 mandates EU digital identity wallets by December 2026."
- Card 4 — Privacy Alternatives Winning: "Google Search → DuckDuckGo, ChatGPT / Gmail → ProtonMail, Hey.com / Chrome → Firefox, Brave / iMessage → Signal" *(add one non-Google example to show pattern is universal)*
- Card 5 — The Gap: "Every major Big Tech product has a privacy-focused competitor — except mobile payments. EU regulation unlocked competition for both Google Wallet and Apple Pay in 2024."
- Sources: European Central Bank, European Commission, US DOJ

**Notes:** This is the single most important slide to update. The legislation card becomes *much* stronger with iOS: the EU NFC opening is a more dramatic regulatory event than the DMA alone, and the DOJ suit adds US pressure. The three regulatory forces (EU NFC, DOJ, eIDAS) tell a compelling "walls are closing in" story. The Gap card now covers both platforms, making Walt's opportunity look twice as large.

## Slide 7: Market Size

**CURRENT:**
- TAM: $18.7B — Global mobile wallet market (2024)
- SAM: $4.2B — European Android tap-to-pay users
- SOM: $21M — 5% of European Android users willing to pay for privacy
- Market Tailwinds: "71% global smartphone market is Android" / "EU digital payments growing 15% annually" / "Pro-privacy, anti-US sentiment in EU"
- Callout: "520M Google Wallet users — All potential Walt converts"

**REPLACEMENT:**
- TAM: $18.7B — Global mobile wallet market (2024) *(keep — defensible from Precedence Research)*
- SAM: $6.9B — European Android + iOS tap-to-pay users *(scaled from $4.2B using Europe OS share: Android 60.5% + iOS 39.0% = 99.5%, so $4.2B × 99.5/60.5 ≈ $6.9B)*
- SOM: $34.5M — 0.5% of European mobile wallet users willing to pay for privacy *(fixes the math error: 0.5% × $6.9B = $34.5M. If you prefer 5%, that's $345M.)*
- Market Tailwinds:
  - "Android + iOS = 99.6% of smartphones globally"
  - "EU digital payments growing 15% annually"
  - "Pro-privacy sentiment accelerating across EU and US"
- Callout: "1.2B Apple Pay + Google Wallet users (est.) — All potential Walt converts"
- Sources: StatCounter (Jan 2026), CoinLaw (est.), Precedence Research

**Notes on SOM math:**
The current deck says "5%" and "$21M" — these don't match regardless of methodology. Options:
- 0.5% × $6.9B = **$34.5M** (conservative, realistic for pre-seed pitch)
- 1% × $6.9B = **$69M**
- 5% × $6.9B = **$345M** (aggressive)
Recommend 0.5% ($34.5M) as the realistic SOM for an early-stage company. The percentage is more believable to investors than claiming 5% capture.

## Slide 8: Team

**CURRENT:**
- Cole Bittel, Founder — DevOps and Infrastructure Engineer, Former: Pleo, Funding Circle, Current: Legora
- Embedded Engineering ApS | Copenhagen, Denmark
- Key Hire 1: BDR / Partnerships — "Unlocking relationships with banks, enabling bank cards across Europe to be loaded into Walt."
- Key Hire 2: Marketing — "Publicizing Walt on Proton, Signal, Brave, and other anti-Google product alternatives."

**REPLACEMENT:**
- *(Founder info: no change)*
- Key Hire 1: *(no change — bank partnerships are platform-agnostic)*
- Key Hire 2: Marketing — "Building brand awareness in privacy-conscious communities: Proton, Signal, Brave, and beyond."

**Changes:** Remove "anti-Google" framing from marketing description. Walt now competes with both platforms; the marketing angle should be pro-privacy rather than anti-one-company.

---

## Slide 9: Business Model

**CURRENT:**
- Price: $3/month
- Subtitle: "Simple pricing that replaces the hidden cost of ad-based wallets."
- Why Subscription? "Aligns incentives with users. Straightforward relationship between customer and company."
- Where It Goes: "Salary — Founder and BDR / partnerships hire" / "Aggregator fees — Aggregator (Paymentology) fees based on monthly active users."
- No Premium Model: "Expanding the product to include more features and a premium model bloats the target of the product and reduces the trust relationship the product is founded on."

**REPLACEMENT:**
- Price: €10/year
- Subtitle: "Simple pricing that replaces the hidden costs of Big Tech wallets."
- Add new element — "How the incumbents make money":
  - Apple Pay: charges banks 0.15% per credit card tap (~$2.7B/year revenue)
  - Google Wallet: $0 fees — monetizes your transaction data through ads
  - Walt: €10/year from you. No bank fees. No data monetization. Ever.
- Why Subscription? *(no change)*
- Where It Goes: *(no change)*
- No Premium Model: *(no change)*

**Notes:** The fee contrast (Apple's 0.15% / Google's data harvesting / Walt's transparent €10) is one of the most powerful storytelling devices in the research. It directly answers "why would anyone pay for a wallet?" — because you're already paying, just not in money. The €10/year aligns with the condensed deck.

## Slide 10: Traction & Roadmap

**CURRENT:**
- H2 2025 Foundation: "Public waitlist live. Aggregator partnership with Paymentology in place. Android application ready for card loading once banks are unlocked."
- Q1 2026 Partnerships: "Find co-founder. First bank contract to unblock card loads."
- Q2 2026 Launch: "First cards loaded. First transactions processed. Geographic expansion begins."
- Current Progress: Paymentology partnership / Android application ready for beta / Public website and signup list
- Key Challenges Ahead: First bank partnership / Legal signoff from Visa and Mastercard / First card load onto Walt

**REPLACEMENT:**
- H2 2025 Foundation: "Public waitlist live. Aggregator partnership with Paymentology in place. Android application ready for card loading once banks are unlocked."
- Q1 2026 Partnerships: "Find co-founder. First bank contract to unblock card loads. Begin iOS development leveraging EU NFC access mandate."
- Q2 2026 Launch: "First cards loaded. First transactions processed. Geographic expansion begins."
- Q3 2026 *(new, optional)*: "iOS app launch in EU markets. Cross-platform feature parity."
- Current Progress: Paymentology partnership / Android application ready for beta / Public website and signup list
- Key Challenges Ahead: First bank partnership / Legal signoff from Visa and Mastercard / First card load onto Walt / iOS NFC integration (EU markets first)

**Notes:** The roadmap changes are modest because iOS development is realistically behind Android. Adding "Begin iOS development" in Q1 2026 and an iOS-specific challenge is honest without overpromising. If you want a bolder timeline, add Q3 2026 as an iOS launch milestone.

---

## Slide 11: The Ask

**CURRENT:**
- Pre-Seed Round: $500K, 18 months runway
- Use of Funds: Business Development Hire 50% / Aggregator Fees 25% / Founder Salary 15% / Marketing 10%

**REPLACEMENT:**
- *(Consider whether any allocation should shift to cover iOS development costs. If not, no changes needed.)*
- Optional: Rename "Business Development Hire" to specify that this includes iOS platform partnerships alongside bank partnerships

**Changes:** Minimal. The fund allocation is platform-agnostic at this level. iOS development can be covered under existing engineering scope.

---

## Slide 12: Closing

**CURRENT:**
> WALT
> "Transaction data is sacred."
> Cole Bittel, Founder
> cole@walt.is
> walt.is
> Embedded Engineering ApS | Copenhagen, Denmark

**REPLACEMENT:** No changes.
