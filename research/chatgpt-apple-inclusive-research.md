Below is a “stat update pack” for the Walt pitch deck (the PDF at `walt.is/pitch`) that expands every **Google/Android-only** metric to include **Apple Pay + iOS**, with slide-ready replacement copy and sources.

A quick note before the numbers: **Apple and Google do not consistently publish global “active users” and “annual $ volume processed” for Apple Pay / Google Wallet.** So you’ll see (1) **more defensible** stats (regulators, Apple newsroom, major publications), and (2) **third‑party estimates** (useful for symmetry, but label as *estimate* in the deck).

---

## Slide 2 — “Google Wallet by the numbers” → “Apple Pay + Google Wallet by the numbers”

### Replace the “520M Google Wallet users / $5.2T processed” block with a 2‑column view

**Apple Pay**

* **785M** Apple Pay *active users worldwide (2024)*. ([Investopedia][1])
* Apple Pay processed **~$6T** in digital payments globally in **2022** (*Capital One estimate, via Payments Dive*). ([Payments Dive][2])
* Apple says Apple Pay is now **available in 89 markets**, with **11,000+ banks/network partners**, and cites “well over **$1B** in fraud” prevented + “more than **$100B** incremental merchant sales.” ([Apple][3])

**Google Wallet / Google Pay**

* Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Google Pay had **150M people across 40 countries** using it (2022). ([The Economic Times][4])

**If you want a symmetric “users + annual processed volume” pair for both wallets (but it’s third‑party):**

* A third‑party comparison estimates **Google Pay ~520M users** and **~$5.2T processed (2025)**; it also estimates **Apple Pay ~650M users** and **~$8.7T processed (2025)**. Use only if you’re comfortable labeling as “est.” in-slide. ([CoinLaw][5])

### Update the Europe contactless stat (optional but more defensible)

Your deck cites “55B contactless card payments in Europe.” A clean, official stat you can use instead:

* **23.2B contactless card payments in the euro area in H2 2023** (+16% YoY), with **€0.6T** total value. ([European Central Bank][6])

**Slide-ready copy example**

* **Apple Pay:** 785M active users (2024) • ~$6T processed (2022 est.)
* **Google Pay/Wallet:** 150M users (40 countries, 2022)
* **Europe:** 23.2B contactless card payments in euro area (H2 2023)

---

## Slide 3 — “Android holds 71%…” → include iOS (and strengthen the “we cover basically the whole market” story)

Replace:

* “Android holds **71%** of the global smartphone market”

With:

* **Worldwide (Jan 2026):** Android **70.36%**, iOS **29.25%** (≈ **99.6% combined**). ([StatCounter Global Stats][7])
* **Europe (Jan 2026):** Android **60.48%**, iOS **38.99%** (≈ **99.5% combined**). ([StatCounter Global Stats][8])

Keep your privacy sentiment stat, but cite it directly:

* **73%** of U.S. adults feel they have **very little or no control** over the data companies collect about them (Pew, May 2023 survey). ([Pew Research Center][9])

**Slide-ready copy example**

* “Android + iOS = ~99%+ of smartphones globally.” ([StatCounter Global Stats][7])
* “73% of consumers feel they have little/no control over company data collection.” ([Pew Research Center][9])

---

## Slide 6 — “Why now” → make the regulatory unlock explicitly about iPhone + Apple Pay

Your current slide implies competition was unlocked for Google Wallet. With iOS support, the *strongest* “why now” proof is the EU forcing NFC openness on iPhone.

### Legislation (core iOS unlock)

* The **European Commission (11 July 2024)** made Apple commitments legally binding to **open iPhone NFC (“tap and go”)** access to rivals under EU antitrust rules. ([European Commission][10])

### Add a U.S. regulatory pressure proof point (optional)

* CFPB commentary/reporting highlights the platform asymmetry: **Android allows third‑party tap‑to‑pay**, while **iOS historically only allowed Apple Pay**, and regulators want more openness. ([Payments Dive][11])

### Update “tap-to-pay is exploding” with more defensible numbers

Instead of “91% of UK 25–34 year olds…”, you can use UK Finance survey stats:

* Among people with contactless-enabled cards, **95%** have used contactless at some point; **17%** use contactless daily; **63%** use it weekly. ([UK Finance][12])
  And/or use ECB growth:
* Euro area contactless card payments **+16% YoY to 23.2B in H2 2023**. ([European Central Bank][6])

**Slide-ready copy example**

* “EU antitrust commitments now force Apple to open iPhone NFC (‘tap and go’) to rival wallets (2024).” ([European Commission][10])
* “Contactless keeps compounding: 23.2B contactless card payments in euro area in H2 2023 (+16% YoY).” ([European Central Bank][6])

## Slide 7 — Market Size → expand SAM/SOM from Android-only to Android+iOS (and update tailwinds)

### Replace/strengthen TAM (your current $18.7B stat is hard to defend consistently)

A highly “slideable” macro stat from Worldpay:

* In **2024**, digital wallets accounted for **$3.6T** online spend and **$12T** in-store spend (and were **53% of e‑commerce** + **32% of POS** spend). ([worldpay.com][13])

This is a cleaner TAM story than niche “market size” revenue figures.

### Update SAM: Europe Android-only → Europe Android+iOS

Your current SAM is “**$4.2B European Android tap-to-pay users**”.

Using Europe OS mix as a scaling factor:

* Europe mobile OS share (Jan 2026): Android **60.48%**, iOS **38.99%**. ([StatCounter Global Stats][8])

If the **$4.2B** figure is Android-only, then adding iOS (holding your existing methodology constant) implies:

* **New Europe SAM (Android + iOS) ≈ $6.9B**
  Calculation: $4.2B × (Android+iOS)/Android = $4.2B × (0.6048+0.3899)/0.6048 ≈ **$6.91B**. ([StatCounter Global Stats][8])

*(That preserves your existing assumptions about penetration and pricing; it just extends to iOS based on OS mix.)*

### Update SOM: fix the math mismatch and extend to iOS

Your slide says “**$21M**” and “**5%**” — those don’t match if SOM is % of SAM.

If you intended:

* **0.5%** of SAM → **~$34.5M** (0.005 × $6.91B)
* **5%** of SAM → **~$345M** (0.05 × $6.91B)

### Update “Market tailwinds” bullets

Replace “71% global smartphone market is Android” with:

* Worldwide (Jan 2026): Android **70.36%**, iOS **29.25%**. ([StatCounter Global Stats][7])

Replace “520M Google Wallet users…” with an Apple+Google statement (pick one pairing style):

**Defensible pairing**

* Apple Pay: **785M active users worldwide (2024)** ([Investopedia][1])
* Google Pay: **150M users across 40 countries (2022)** ([The Economic Times][4])

**Symmetric-estimate pairing (label as estimate)**

* Apple Pay + Google Pay user counts and processed volumes (2025 est.) ([CoinLaw][5])

---

## What to actually change in the deck (copy/paste suggestions)

### Anywhere you currently say…

* “Google Wallet users” → change to **“Apple Pay + Google Wallet users”** (and show each with its own number + year)
* “Android market share” → change to **“Android + iOS market share”**
* “Replacement for Google Wallet wasn’t possible…” → change to **“Replacement for Apple Pay wasn’t possible on iPhone until EU NFC access opened (2024)”** ([European Commission][10])

---

If you want, paste the specific slide text blocks you’re planning to keep (or the Keynote/PPT export), and I can rewrite the *exact* slide copy so it stays the same length and style—but with the iOS + Apple Pay numbers slotted in and properly source-labeled.
